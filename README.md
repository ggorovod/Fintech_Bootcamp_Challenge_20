Developed smart contracts to automate several financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. Automated the creation of joint savings accounts. Created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
